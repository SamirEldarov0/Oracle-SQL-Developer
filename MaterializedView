delete from random_table where ID=1

select*from mv_random_table--materialized view-den silinmeyecek

refresh materialized view mv_random_table

create materialized view vw_random_table
as
select ID,AVG(val),count(1) from random_table

select*from vw_random_table--it still take some time,view select ID,AVG(val),count(1) from random_table kimi run olunur

-- Difference between view and mv ,View will only store the select statement when it's created
--MV store both the select statement as well as data returned from that select statement
